## üìÑ Description

Create a local service in the computer that works as a DNS updater. The router has an
option to configure a custom service for dynamic DNS, therefore, this service could
live in the server, and use the API from DigitalOcean to update the DNS record when
the IP changes.

This [service](https://www.ipify.org/) allows to get the remote IP, using:

```bash
 $ curl 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'
 ```

 Or clicking [here](https://api.ipify.org/).
