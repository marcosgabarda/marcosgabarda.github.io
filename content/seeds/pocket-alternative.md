## 📄 Description

The service [pocket](https://getpocket.com/) is going to be closed. Therefore, I think
I could develop a service that would be an alternative self-hosted.

The service could be at first an API to save and retrieve the links, with tags, and
later add a way to:

- cache the contend, creating a clean version of the article
- check for down links

## ✅ Development Status

- [x] Idea drafted
- [ ] Initial research
- [ ] First prototype
- [ ] Published on the blog
- [ ] Archived / abandoned

## 🏷️ Additional Notes

- Given a web page, create a minimum version in Markdown of the content, to be cached.
- Import data from the exported csv from Pocket.
