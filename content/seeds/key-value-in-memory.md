## 📄 Description

Design a lightweight, in-memory key-value store inspired by Redis, implemented
entirely in Python. The goal is to learn about efficient data structures, concurrency,
and serialization/deserialization techniques.

## ✅ Development Status

- [x] Idea drafted
- [x] Initial research
- [ ] First prototype
- [ ] Published on the blog
- [ ] Archived / abandoned

## 🏷️ Additional Notes

- Consider using `asyncio` or `threading` to simulate concurrency.
- Look into projects like `tinydb`, `pickleDB`, or `redis-py` for inspiration.
