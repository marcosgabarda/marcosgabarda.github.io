## Welcome to my digital garden 🌱

I'm a **software engineer**, doing stuff with Python 🐍

### Some things I love to do

- ⚔️ Historical fencing with **long sword**
- 📷 Photography with my old and reliable **Nikon D5300**
- 🎲 **D&D** dungeon master and solo role games
- 🎨 Paint and collect **Aeldari** armies from Warhammer 40.000
- 👾 Play **video games**
- 🥘 Cook **paella valenciana** (the real one)

These are some general things about me, but you can check my [now](@/now/index.md) 
page to know what I am up to.
