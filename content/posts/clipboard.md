# Installing clipboard tool for Wayland

In my eternal journey to learn **nvim** and to use more the terminal, I would need to 
share the clipboard between the system and nvim itself.

To be able to do that on my Debian 12, with Wayland and KDE, I need to install the 
following package:

```
sudo apt install wl-clipboard
```
