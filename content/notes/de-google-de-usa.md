## Migrating e-mail

I've been a user of Gmail since almost the beginning, I remember the "beta" in the logo
and how a space of 1GB was a game changer.

- classic IMAP server, like [dondominio.com](https://www.dondominio.com/es/products/email/)


## Git

Other service I was a early user is GitHub. In fact, while I'm writing this words, this
site is hosted in GitHub Pages.

Alternatives to GitHub:

- [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org)
- [tangled.org](https://tangled.org)

## Static web hosting

- [statichost.eu](https://www.statichost.eu/)
