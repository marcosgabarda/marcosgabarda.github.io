## 📄 Description

Investigate the potential of building a Python library or package to connect 
geospatial data pipelines using GeoParquet files, efficient queries via DuckDB, and 
publishing through GeoServer. This stack could simplify modern geospatial workflows.

## ✅ Development Status

- [x] Idea drafted
- [x] Initial research
- [ ] First prototype
- [ ] Published on the blog
- [ ] Archived / abandoned

## 🏷️ Additional Notes

- Try DuckDB with its spatial extension and test with `geopandas` or `shapely`.
- Consider packaging: CLI + Python module.
