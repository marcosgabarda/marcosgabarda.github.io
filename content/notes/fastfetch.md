I use [fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) as alternative to
neofetch to gather system information.

1. Download the latest `.deb` package released from [here](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch/releases).

2. Install the package:

```bash
sudo apt install ./fastfetch-linux-amd64.deb
```

My current system information:
